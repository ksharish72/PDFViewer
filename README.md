Instructions
Design a web page similar in structure to the Adobe Acrobat Reader’s view mode with the sidebar
displaying document outline and content in the center. The sidebar should provide a expandable
navigation feature which lets the document / main content to be organized with sections and
subsections. If internal links are used to navigate to a different part of the document, the sidebar display
should update dynamically to reflect the same.
The the top portion of the page should display breadcrumbs used to reach a certain part of the
document dynamically, as we switch over from one part to another. If a long path is followed, the
breadcrumb should display just the starting point and the last few parts of the path followed, shrinking
the entire intermediate path followed to something nominal. (e.g: something like “../../” ).
Any further improvements to the UX are welcome. It is important that the overall experience of
navigating and viewing the content remain seamless.
